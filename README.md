# Testing Grounds
A small FPS game based on the Unreal Developer course on UDemy

This small game is built over many lectures during the Unreal Editor Developer course on UDemy taught by Ben Tristem.  It is loosely based on the Hunger Games.  The player must navigate through many areas avoiding the guards.  If he is detected, the player must clear all the guards from the area before the door to the next room will open.
